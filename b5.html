    <div>
        <p>A comma-separated list of selectors represents the union of all elements selected by each of the individual <br>selectors in the list. (A comma is U+002C.) For example, in CSS when several selectors share the same <br>declarations, they may be grouped into a comma-separated list. White space may appear before and/or after the <br>commae</p>

    <div class="block-code">
        <p> &#160; CSS example: <br> 
            &#160; In this example, we condense three rules with identical declarations into one. Thus, <br>
            &#160; h1 { font-family: sans-serif } <br>
            &#160; h2 { font-family: sans-serif } <br>
            &#160; h3 { font-family: sans-serif } <br>
            &#160; is equivalent to: <br>
            &#160; h1, h2, h3 { font-family; sans-serif }
        </p>
